                    <ul>
                        <li>The background imagine in the homepage didn't appear when I added style.css into the css folder.
                        <br>- I fixed the problem by adding the image directly into the html file by using the style element (nothing else works except adding the image as an url link).</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The description text on my products would overlay my navbar.
                        <br>- The problem was that I accidentally added opacity which made it like that.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The icon fonts i added for contactpage wouldn't appear.
                        <br>- The link to the icon fonts wasn't correct which is the reason why it didn't appear.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The control arrows in the slideshow would move up and down depending on the image displayed.
                        <br>- By giving all the shown images the same height fixed the problem.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>(Sidebar): By making the position fixed it can overlay everything else instead of making anything shrink/collaps. 
                            With a transition it can slide open and close smoothly, 
                            and by having a transition that makes the menu links move on hover helps you see where your mouse is and it's less boring. 
                            Keeping the navbar sticky makes it easier to access the menu while scrolling.</li>
                    </ul>
